COMP 20 Spring 2018 Private Repo for Laurel Haeger

1. This repository stores the files from Comp 20 assignments and labs from throughout the semester.

2. My favorite assignment was notuber becuase I felt that it showed tangible data. Sometimes when you are working on projects, the final output doesn't really show much, but this assignment had a clear final creation that was fun to see in action. 

3. I think this class has taught me a lot about how to complete more open-ended projects. Although I experienced some of this in my internship last summer, I have never had a class where the assignments and labs simply had a final goal, but not as many structured steps to get there. For obvious reasons, I think this will be very helpful in the working world in the future and I think it was crucial that I was able to learn how to do this in a classroom/friendlier setting. 

4. The most important thing I learned this semester was the world is constantly changing and that means we have to change with it. In the final project, my group had very lofty goals for our final website that became unattainable pretty quickly. Whether is was the Instagram API no longer really existing, or the Facebook API not working the way that was needed, I've learned that it is important to be able to adapt and make changes, without completely throwing away the original idea. Additionally, when you work in a group people are constantly having other obstacles to deal with, so I've learned that communication is key in the beginning, so that when things go awry in life, it's not the end of the world and the things can keep moving forward. 

5. I think I would like to work more with back end server information. Specifically with data and the way we store/analyze/etc. it.
